<div class="purple-text">
    <p style="display:inline">I don’t actually want to be white, I just don’t 
        want to think about it... Although I'm not likely to become a victim
        of police brutality and violent hatecrimes, I don't want to think about
        the possibilities as I'm still a someone who is fetishized by white men
        for her race and despised by Asian men for being a woman. </p>
